AVOID RUN-ON SENTENCES

NARRATIVE STRUCTURE (within one paragraph):
1. BEGINNING (1-2 sentences): Establish protagonist in their ordinary world, introduce their initial situation
2. RISING ACTION (2-3 sentences): Present the inciting incident, escalating challenges, and mounting obstacles
3. CLIMAX (1-2 sentences): Hint at the major confrontation or turning point without revealing specifics
4. FALLING ACTION (1 sentence): Suggest the resolution path and character growth without spoiling the outcome

STRUCTURE & FLOW:
- Begin with a compelling hook that establishes the protagonist and their ordinary world
- Smoothly transition through the four narrative beats within one cohesive paragraph
- Build tension progressively from beginning through climax
- End with intrigue about the resolution that makes readers want more

TONE & LANGUAGE:
- Use active, engaging language that creates momentum
- Appeal to YA readers (ages 13-18) with age-appropriate vocabulary
- Balance accessibility with sophistication
- Create emotional resonance through character-driven conflict
- Employ transitional phrases to connect narrative beats smoothly

CONTENT GUIDELINES:
- Focus on the protagonist's complete journey arc from ordinary world to transformation
- Highlight unique aspects of the setting that impact each story phase
- Establish clear stakes that escalate throughout the narrative structure
- Include hints of character growth and transformation in the falling action
- Create intrigue without spoiling major plot points or the final resolution
- Emphasize themes relevant to young adult readers throughout the arc

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Multiple paragraphs or lengthy descriptions
- Giving away major plot twists or the ending
- Skipping any of the four narrative structure elements
- Overly detailed world-building exposition
- Passive voice or static descriptions
- Generic or clichÃ©d language"""
